# Example app using Bower and Node server

This is just a simple example of a Heroku compatible app using Bower to manage client dependencies and Node acting as a static server. I did it as a learning exercise.

## Running Locally

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
